# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to the Requirement Analysis phase of a booking management system project.

The primary objective is to document and analyze all necessary requirements—both functional and non-functional—to establish a solid foundation for software development. This includes identifying system actors, drafting use case diagrams, and defining clear acceptance criteria.

By following industry-standard practices, this repository aims to simulate a real-world project scenario and prepare for effective and scalable software design and development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements of a software system. This process ensures a clear understanding between stakeholders, project managers, and developers about what the system is expected to do.

The goal of Requirement Analysis is to identify the exact needs of users and stakeholders and translate them into detailed functional and non-functional requirements that guide the design, development, and testing of the system.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

- **Clear Communication**: It acts as a bridge between clients and developers by establishing a common understanding of project goals.
- **Risk Reduction**: By identifying problems early, it minimizes the risk of project failure or costly changes later in development.
- **Scope Management**: Clearly defined requirements help control project scope and avoid feature creep.
- **Foundation for Design and Testing**: It serves as a blueprint for software architecture, coding, and quality assurance processes.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: When requirements are well-defined and understood, the final product is more likely to meet user expectations.

In short, effective Requirement Analysis lays the foundation for successful software development by ensuring that the right product is built for the right purpose.
