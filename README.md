# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to the Requirement Analysis phase of a booking management system project.

The primary objective is to document and analyze all necessary requirements—both functional and non-functional—to establish a solid foundation for software development. This includes identifying system actors, drafting use case diagrams, and defining clear acceptance criteria.

By following industry-standard practices, this repository aims to simulate a real-world project scenario and prepare for effective and scalable software design and development.
